# To-Do List on Browser
This JavaScript version is a simple HTML page with JavaScript for managing tasks in the browser.  
It provides an input field to add new tasks, a button to add tasks to the list, a button to remove selected tasks, and a list to display the tasks.
It uses __localStorage__ to store and retrieve data.  
This way, tasks will persist between page reloads.
